[cite_start]Here is a chapter-wise analysis of predicted questions for your Winter 2025 exam, based on the syllabus [cite: 237, 238] and a frequency analysis of the six provided past papers.

The probability is calculated based on the frequency of the topic appearing in the last six exams (e.g., a topic appearing in all 6 papers has a probability of 1.0). Within each chapter, questions are sorted from most probable to least probable.
